# CI Guardrails:
# - Resolve API base once; never curl a blank URL (API_BASE_STAGING -> STAGING_BASE).
# - Skip posting to Notion/GitHub when secrets/vars are missing.
# - Normalize: ROADMAP_DATABASE_ID = ROADMAP_DATABASE_ID || NOTION_DATABASE_ID.
# - Route contract: /health = .ok only; /projections = trust headers + schema.
# - Use scripts + jq; avoid inline JSON in YAML.
