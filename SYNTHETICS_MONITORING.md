---

## üß™ Test Your Monitors

### Simulate Downtime

```bash
# Temporarily break the health endpoint (do this on staging first!)
# Option 1: Deploy broken code
# Option 2: Pause the Worker in Cloudflare Dashboard
# Option 3: Set a firewall rule blocking your monitor IPs

# Wait for alerts (should receive within 3-5 minutes)
# Restore service
# Verify recovery notification
```

### Simulate Slow Response

```bash
# Add artificial delay to API route
# Wait for performance alert
# Remove delay
# Verify alert clears
```
