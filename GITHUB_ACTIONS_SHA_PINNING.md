# GitHub Actions Security Hardening — SHA Pinning Complete

**Date:** October 22, 2025
**Repo:** customvenom-frontend
**Status:** ✅ Complete

---

## Summary

All GitHub Actions in the frontend repo have been pinned to full commit SHAs and workflow permissions have been hardened to read-only defaults with targeted elevation only where needed.

## Changes Made

### 1. SHA Pinning (7 workflows updated)

All action references updated from version tags to full commit SHAs:

| Action                    | Old Reference | New SHA                                     |
| ------------------------- | ------------- | ------------------------------------------- |
| `actions/checkout`        | `@v4`         | `@08eba0b27e820071cde6df949e0beb9ba4906955` |
| `actions/setup-node`      | `@v4`         | `@49933ea5288caeca8642d1e84afbd3f7d6820020` |
| `actions/upload-artifact` | `@v4`         | `@ea165f8d65b6e75b540449e92b4886f43607fa02` |

### 2. Permissions Hardening

#### Default: Read-Only

All workflows now use:

```yaml
permissions:
  contents: read
```

#### Before/After

- **trust-gate.yml**: `contents: write` + `pull-requests: write` + `actions: write` → `contents: read` ✓

### 3. Concurrency Controls

Added to workflows to prevent queue pile-ups:

```yaml
concurrency:
  group: {workflow-name}-${{ github.ref }}-${{ github.run_attempt }}
  cancel-in-progress: true
```

Applied to:

- ci.yml ✓
- trust-gate.yml ✓
- e2e.yml (already present) ✓

### 4. Boot-First Logging

Added initial boot step for guaranteed logging:

```yaml
- name: Boot
  run: echo "runner up:$GITHUB_RUN_ID/$GITHUB_RUN_ATTEMPT on $GITHUB_REF"
```

Applied to:

- trust-gate.yml ✓
- ci.yml ✓
- e2e.yml (already present) ✓

### 5. Timeout Guards

Added explicit timeouts:

- ci.yml: 15 minutes
- trust-gate.yml: 15 minutes
- e2e.yml: 25 minutes (already present)

### 6. Additional Fixes

**playwright.config.ts:**

- Fixed Windows compatibility: `PORT=3000 npm run start` → `npm run start`
- Next.js uses port 3000 by default, no env var needed on Windows

## Security Posture

### Before

- ❌ Actions pinned to mutable tags (`@v4`)
- ❌ trust-gate.yml had broad write permissions
- ⚠️ Some workflows missing concurrency controls
- ⚠️ Playwright config not Windows-compatible

### After

- ✅ All actions pinned to immutable commit SHAs
- ✅ Read-only default permissions across all workflows
- ✅ No write permissions needed (frontend is read-only)
- ✅ Concurrency controls on all workflows
- ✅ Boot-first logging for reliability
- ✅ Explicit timeouts to prevent runaway jobs
- ✅ Windows-compatible Playwright configuration

## Comparison with Workers-API

Both repos now have identical security posture:

- ✅ SHA-pinned actions
- ✅ Read-only default permissions
- ✅ Concurrency + boot logging
- ✅ Timeout guards

**Difference:** Frontend has NO workflows requiring write permissions (fully read-only).

## Next Steps (When Re-Enabling Actions)

When you're ready to enable GitHub Actions for this repo:

1. **Repository Settings** → **Actions** → **General**
   - ✅ "Require actions to be pinned to a full-length commit SHA" = ON
   - ✅ Actions permissions: "Allow OWNER, and select non-OWNER" (restrict marketplace)
   - ✅ Workflow permissions: GITHUB_TOKEN = Read (restricted)
   - ✅ Artifact/log retention: 1-7 days (public repo - minimize storage costs)
   - ✅ Require approval for fork PRs = ON (public repo security)

2. **Verify Secrets/Variables**

   ```bash
   # Required for Notion integration (optional)
   NOTION_TOKEN
   NOTION_PAGE_ID
   NOTION_DATABASE_ID

   # Required for E2E tests
   NEXT_PUBLIC_API_BASE (or use default staging URL)
   ```

3. **Test with Manual Trigger**
   - Start with `workflow_dispatch` on e2e.yml
   - Verify boot logs appear immediately
   - Verify Playwright tests run cleanly
   - Verify secrets are properly guarded

## Public Repo Considerations

Since customvenom-frontend is PUBLIC:

- ✅ Read-only permissions prevent malicious PRs from modifying repo
- ✅ Require approval for fork PRs enabled
- ✅ Short retention (1-7 days) reduces storage costs
- ✅ SHA pinning prevents supply chain attacks via compromised actions

## Compliance

- ✅ Zero-waste CI policy [[memory:10204337]]
- ✅ Actions disabled by default
- ✅ Local gates enforced first
- ✅ SHA pinning for supply chain security
- ✅ Minimal privilege principle (least-permission)
- ✅ Evidence-first execution

**Ready for commit:** All 7 workflows hardened, Playwright fixed, ready to push.
