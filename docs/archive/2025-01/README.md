# Documentation Archive - January 2025

This folder contains archived documentation that was moved during a cleanup effort to reduce repository clutter and focus on active, high-signal documentation.

## Archive Criteria

Files were moved here based on:
- **Age**: Files older than 30 days with no recent updates
- **Size**: Large files (>10KB) that appeared to be dumps or generated content
- **Relevance**: Implementation summaries, handoff documents, and phase completion reports that are no longer actively referenced
- **Duplication**: Multiple versions of similar documents

## What Was Kept

The following high-signal documentation remains in the main repository:
- `README.md` - Main project documentation
- `CONTRIBUTING.md` - Contribution guidelines
- `CHANGELOG.md` - Version history
- `SECURITY.md` - Security policies
- `CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md` - Community guidelines
- `.github/` - GitHub templates and workflows
- `docs/` - Active documentation referenced by CI/build
- `LOCAL_GATE_RUNBOOK.md` - Active operational procedures

## Archive Contents

This archive contains:
- Implementation summaries and handoff documents
- Phase completion reports
- Troubleshooting guides for resolved issues
- Setup guides for completed configurations
- Session summaries and work logs
- Duplicate or superseded documentation

## Access

All archived content remains searchable and accessible. If you need to reference any archived document, it can be moved back to the main repository or linked from active documentation.

## Maintenance

This archive will be reviewed quarterly. Documents that become relevant again can be restored to the main repository.
