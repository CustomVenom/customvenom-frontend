# Database Migration Verification Report

## Completed Steps

### ✅ 1. Environment Setup

- **DATABASE_URL** set locally using Windows PowerShell:
  - Used `setx DATABASE_URL "..."` for persistent environment variable
  - Created `.env.local` file with all required environment variables including DATABASE_URL

### ✅ 2. Schema Migration

- **Prisma schema** pushed to Neon database successfully
  - Command: `prisma db push`
  - Result: "Your database is now in sync with your Prisma schema. Done in 3.74s"
  - Tables created:
    - ✓ `AnalyticsEvent`
    - ✓ `HourlyRollup`

### ✅ 3. Database Verification

Direct database query confirmed:

```
Total Events: 2
Total Rollups: 1

Recent Events:
  - tool_used / Start/Sit (test-200...)
  - tool_used / Start/Sit (test-session-17...)

Recent Rollups:
  - 2025-10-18T12:00:00.000Z: 1 events, 1 sessions
```

### ✅ 4. API Endpoint Testing

#### POST /api/analytics/track

- **Status:** 200 OK ✓
- **Test:** Successfully created analytics events
- **Database Verification:** Events appear in database immediately
- **Sample Response:**

```json
{
  "ok": true,
  "event_id": "cmgw4p0dp0001nd2gn39nuql5"
}
```

#### GET /api/analytics/rollups?hours=24

- **Status:** 200 OK ✓
- **Response:**

```json
{
  "ok": true,
  "count": 1,
  "hours": 24,
  "total_events": 1,
  "total_sessions": 1,
  "rollups": [
    {
      "hour": "2025-10-18T12:00:00.000Z",
      "event_counts": { "tool_used": 1 },
      "tool_usage": { "Start/Sit": 1 },
      "risk_distribution": {},
      "unique_sessions": 1,
      "total_events": 1
    }
  ]
}
```

#### GET /api/analytics/track?hours=24

- **Status:** 200 OK ✓
- **Returns:** List of recent events with full details
- **Count:** 2 events in range

### ✅ 5. Development Server

- **Status:** Running on port 3000
- **Process ID:** 14344
- **Configuration:** Loaded from `.env.local`

## Manual Verification Required

### /ops/metrics Page

Please manually verify in your browser:

1. Navigate to http://localhost:3000/ops/metrics
2. Verify that cache tile renders (shows cache status, age, size, week, hit rate)
3. Verify that analytics tiles render (Total Events, Tool Usage, etc.)
4. Check for no regressions or console errors

**Note:** The /ops/metrics page currently uses localStorage for analytics display (Phase 2.1). The database-backed API endpoints are working but the page UI hasn't been migrated to use them yet.

## Files Created/Modified

### Created:

- `.env.local` - Environment variables including DATABASE_URL

### Modified:

- None (schema was already in place)

## Database Connection String

Connection string has been set but is not displayed here for security.
Format: `postgresql://neondb_owner:***@ep-quiet-frog-ad4o9gki-pooler.c-2.us-east-1.aws.neon.tech/neondb?sslmode=require&channel_binding=require`

## Next Steps

1. Open http://localhost:3000/ops/metrics in your browser
2. Verify all tiles render correctly
3. Check browser console for any errors
4. If all looks good, respond with "run acceptance"
