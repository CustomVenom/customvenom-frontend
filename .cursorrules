Before modifying any code:
1. State the task and acceptance criteria
2. Read all files that will be modified
3. Show relevant existing code
4. Propose specific changes with before/after
5. Wait for approval before executing
6. Report what changed and acceptance status

Never:
- Code without reading files first
- Make assumptions about existing code
- Modify multiple unrelated files without approval
- Change button text or UI copy without explicit approval

Always:
- Quote existing code when discussing changes
- Follow existing patterns in the codebase
- Ask for clarification when scope is ambiguous
- Reference docs/NOTION_RESOURCES.md for roadmap alignment before starting new features
